On this repository, I publish a Exercise of Algorithms on java, for ech one of exercises you need to use the next 
command lines:

* Clean project - mvn clean
* Test the algorithm with Test Unit - mvn test

**Notes:** 
* On te creation of projects, we use Apache maven v 3.6.1 
* This examples use JUnit Lib  v4.13.1

**ORDER Numbers**

The task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially rearrange the digits to create the highest number possible.

> Example:

* orderNumbers(21445) -> 54421
* orderNumbers(145263) -> 654321
* orderNumbers(1254859723) -> 9875543221
