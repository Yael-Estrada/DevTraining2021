ORDER Numbers

The task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially rearrange the digits to create the highest number possible.

Example:

* orderNumbers(21445) -> 54421
* orderNumbers(145263) -> 654321
* orderNumbers(1254859723) -> 9875543221
