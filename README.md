# DevTraining2021

On this repository, I publish a Exercise of Algorithms on java, for ech one of exercises you need to use the next 
command lines:

* Clean project - mvn clean
* Test the algorithm with Test Unit - mvn test

**Notes:** 
* On te creation of projects, we use Apache maven v 3.6.1 
* This examples use JUnit Lib  v4.13.1

> **Isogram**

An isogram is a word that has no repeating, consecutive, or non-consecutive letters. Implement a function that determines whether a string containing only letters is an isogram. Suppose the empty string is an isogram. Ignore upper and lower case.

> Example:
* isIsograma("dermatoglyphics") -> true
* isIsograma("mooose") -> false
* isIsograma("aba") -> false
